# GPCR_AF2
## Master Project
This project aims at using Alphafold 2 for benchmark and enrichment in order to test its performance of predicting protein structure(GPCR specifically). The interaction of the protein-ligand complex is checked and evaluated for further study. 

For information of how to run AlphaFold, visit [alphafold github](https://github.com/deepmind/alphafold).

## Summer Project
In this project, the latest version of AlphaFold is being used to select promising small protein ligand for certain orphan GPCRs.
